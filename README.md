In the example provided earlier, we fetched weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, which gives weather forecasts and historical data for various locations. The response included details like temperature, humidity,etc.Fetching data from public APIs and visualizing it using tools like matplotlib and seaborn is a powerful way to extract meaningful insights from raw data. By combining real-time data with clear visual representations, we can make better decisions, predict future trends, and communicate findings effectively. Whether it's weather forecasting, market analysis, or monitoring IoT systems, these techniques have a broad range of applications in many industries.
